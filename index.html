          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding foundations-module-1">
            <h2>Foundations Module 01. Naming Things</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">In Swahili, there are no masculine or feminine genders. Sounds like good news but there are actually a lot more genders (or classes) than in English, depending on the noun. For example, <em>kiti</em> (= chair) belongs to a different gender or class than <em>mke</em> (= woman).</p>
            <p class="medium-text">The noun class system is the foundation of the Swahili language and the most difficult thing for newcomers. In this module of 8 lessons, we'll teach you an intuitive way to grasp how naming works in Swahili. Then we'll help you master the system with engaging interactive exercises.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Foundations Module 02. Describing Things</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">Once you know how to name things, it'll be time to describe them. In Swahili, the adjectives and different pronouns change depending on the class of the noun they're referring to.</p>
            <p class="medium-text">Throughout the 13 lessons of this module, you'll learn to use the different types of adjectives and pronouns, the date and time systems, how to ask questions and compare things. Thanks to the fun interactive exercises, you'll soon be able to describe things confidently.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Foundations Module 03. Making sentences</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">In this last key module, you'll reach proficiency by learning to produce various types of sentences, using all the tenses and the core grammatical constructs of the Swahili language.</p>
            <p class="medium-text">With its 37 lessons, this module is the biggest. In the end, you'll know more than 2000 words. You'll be able to understand the gist of most spoken conversations and written text in Swahili. You'll also be able to express yourself by speaking or writing. <strong>You'll be proficient!</strong> 🎉</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Conversation Modules. Becoming Fluent</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">After completing the Foundations cycle, you can stay with us to gradually reach the fluency level. The conversation modules are a form of virtual immersion in the Swahili-speaking world. The goal is to broaden your vocabulary, increase your listening, your speaking, your writing, and your reading skills to make you an advanced Swahili speaker.</p>
          </div>
            <p class="medium-text">The conversation modules consist of a weekly personal study of a piece of media or a specific theme (news articles, essays, books, traditional tales, news reports, tv shows, movies/documentaries, speeches, interviews, songs, etc.). The piece is then discussed collectively during a live meeting and Q&A session on Zoom, involving our Swahili teachers and the other members at this level.</p>

              <h2>Jambo, Hotep, Mbote, Greetings. 👋</h2>
              <p class="big-text">My name is Abiola Ismaël Sow. Being a Pan Africanist for several years now, I've always yearned to learn Swahili. Why? I'm convinced it's the only language that can unite African people around the world and help us create the United States of Africa: 👉 the most important step toward real Black Power.</p>

              <p class="big-text"><strong>After making limited progress since 2015</strong>, I've set out to solve the problem once and for all. Originally a French speaker, I've reached proficiency in English by self-studying without visiting any English-speaking country. Today I perform real-time translation for both English and French speakers at political conferences.</p>  
              
              <p class="big-text">I'm using that experience to create the most effective Swahili program for myself and the African community at large. First, I work with a select team of Swahili teachers in Kenya and Tanzania to create high-quality learning content. Secondly, I leverage my computer programming skills to create the most fun and interactive learning environment possible.</p>
