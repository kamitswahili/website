            <div class="big-text"><p>Three key modules that will take you from beginner to proficient.</p><p></p></div>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding foundations-module-1">
            <h2>Foundations Module 01. Naming Things</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">In Swahili there are no masculine and feminine genders. Sounds like good news but there are actually a lot more genders (or classes) than in English, depending of the noun. For example kiti (= chair) belongs to a different gender or class than mke (= woman).</p>
            <p class="medium-text">The noun class system is the foundation of the Swahili language and the thing that causes the most difficulty to people learning Swahili. In this module of 8 lessons, we'll teach you an intuitive way to grasp how naming things work in Swahili. Then we'll help you master it with engaging interactive exercices.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Foundations Module 02. Describing Things</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">Once you know how to properly name things, it's time to be able to describe them. In Swahili, the adjectives and different pronouns change depending on the class of the noun they are referring to.</p>
            <p class="medium-text">Throughout the 13 lessons of this module, you'll learn to use the different types of adjectives and pronouns, the date and time system, how to ask questions and compare things. Thanks to the fun interactive exercices, you'll soon be able to describe things confidently.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Foundations Module 03. Making sentences</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">In this last key module, you'll reach proficiency by learning to produce various types of sentences, using all the tenses and all the main grammatical constructs of the Swahili language.</p>
            <p class="medium-text">With its 37 lessons, this module is the biggest but it's not more difficult than the previous ones. At the end you'll know more than 2000 words. You'll be able to understand the gist of most spoken conversations and written text in Swahili. You'll also be able to express yourself by speaking or writing. You'll be proficient.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="big-top-padding">
            <h2>Conversation Modules. Becoming Fluent</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">Once you finish the Foundations cycle, you can stay with us to gradually reach fluency level. The conversation modules are a form of virtual immersion in the Swahili world. The goal is to broaden your vocabulary, increase your listening, speaking, writing, and reading skills to make you an advanced Swahili speaker.</p>
            <p class="medium-text">It's based upon a weekly personal study of a piece of media or a specific theme (news articles, essays, books, tales, news reports, tv shows, movies/documentaries, speeches, interviews, songs etc.). The piece is then discussed collectively during a live meeting & QA session on Zoom, involving our Swahili teachers and the other students at this level.</p>

              <h2>Jambo, Hotep, Mbote, Greetings. 👋</h2>
              <p class="big-text">My name is Abiola Ismaël Sow. I've been a Pan Africanist for several years and I've decided to learn Swahili. Why? Because I'm convinced it's the only language that can unite African people around the world and help us create the United States of Africa: 👉 the most important step toward real Black Power.</p>

              <p class="big-text"><strong>After making limited progress since 2015</strong>, I've set out to solve the problem once and for all. I've already reached proficiency in English by self-studying before visiting any English-speaking country. I'm now using this experience to create the most effective program to teach Swahili to myself and to other brothers and sisters.</p>
              
              <p class="big-text">To do so, I'm leveraging my computer programming skills to create a super interactive learning environment and a select team of talented Swahili teachers from Kenya and Tanzania to create high-quality Swahili learning material.</p>
